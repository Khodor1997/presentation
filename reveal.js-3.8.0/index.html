					<h1>History of Programming Languages</h1>
					<p>by Khodor Pavel</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>The history of programming languages spans from documentation of early mechanical computers to modern tools for software development.</p>
				</section>

					<section>
					<h4><p>Programming languages ​​are usually divided into five generations.</p></h4>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment"><span>Machine code</span></li>
							<li class="fragment"><span>Assembly</span></li>
							<li class="fragment"><span>High level language</span></li>
							<li class="fragment"><span>Structural programming</span></li>
							<li class="fragment"><span>OOP</span></li>

						<h3>Machine code</h3>
						<p>Machine code is a computer program written in machine language. It uses the instruction set of a particular computer architecture. It is usually written in binary. Machine code is the lowest level of software.</p>

					<section>
							<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
							<ul>
								<li><span>It is very difficult to program in machine language. The programmer has to know details of hardware to write program.</span></li>
								<li><span>The programmer has to remember a lot of codes to write a program which results in program errors.</span></li>
								<li><span>It is difficult to debug the program.</span></li>
								<li><span>Very long programs.</span></li>
							</ul>
					</section>

						<h3>Assembly language</h3>
						<p>Assembly  is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions</p>

						 <h3>High-level programming languages</h3>
						 <p>Since the mid 50's. of XX century the first high-level programming languages appeared.
							These languages were not tied to a particular type of computer. Each of them has its own compilers.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Advantages of High level language</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><span>High level languages are programmer friendly. They are easy to write, debug and maintain.</span></li>
							<li><span>It provide higher level of abstraction from machine languages.</span></li>
							<li><span>It is machine independent language.</span></li>
							<li><span>Easy to learn.</span></li>
							<li><span>Less error prone, easy to find and debug errors.</span></li>
							<li><span>High level programming results in better programming productivity.</span></li>
						</ul>

					<h3><span style='color: #ff7d03'>Fortran</span> programming language</h3>
					<img src="img/becus.jpg" alt="">
					<p>The first high-level language Fortran was created between 1954 and 1957 by a group of programmers led by John Backus at IBM. It was intended for scientific and technical calculations. Fortan is still in use today.</p>

						<h3><span style='color: #ff7d03'>LISP</span> programming language</h3>
						<img height ='185px' width ='150' src="img/Stev.jpg" alt="">
						<p>John McCarthy developed Lisp in 1958 while he was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Linked lists are one of Lisp's major data structures, and Lisp source code is made of lists.</p><br><br>

							<li><span>computer science</span></li>
							<li><span>tree data structures</span></li>

							<li><span>dynamic typing</span></li>
							<li><span>conditionals</span></li>
							<li><span>higher-order functions</span></li>
							<li><span>recursion</span></li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Lisp 1960</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><span>List/symbolic processing</span></li>
							<li><span>Initially (and often still) interpreted</span></li>
							<li><span>Dozens (most likely hundreds) of dialects</span>
								<ul>
									<li>“Lisp has an implied plural”</li>
									<li>Common Lisp</li>
									<li>Scheme</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><span>This family of languages has been (and is) the mainstay of artificial intelligence (AI) research</span>
								<ul>
									<li>Though delivered products have often been in C or C++</li>

						<h3>Church–Turing thesis</h3>
						<p>
								In computability theory, the Church–Turing thesis is a hypothesis about the nature of computable functions.<br><br>
								It states that a function on the natural numbers can be calculated by an effective method if and only if it is computable by a Turing machine.
								
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
							<h3>Formalize the notion of computability:</h3>
							<ul style = 'font-size:25px'>
								<li><span>In 1933, Kurt Gödel, with Jacques Herbrand, created a formal definition of a class called general recursive functions</span></li>
								<li><span>In 1936, Alonzo Church created a method for defining functions called the λ-calculus.</span></li>
								<li><span>Alan Turing created a theoretical model for machines, now called Turing machines, that could carry out calculations from inputs by manipulating symbols on a tape.</span></li>
							</ul>
							<p style='text-align:left;color:#000; font-size:30px; background:#fff700'><em>Church and Turing proved that these three formally defined classes of computable functions coincide: a function is λ-computable if and only if it is Turing computable, and if and only if it is <b>general recursive</b>.</em></p>

						<p><b>C</b> was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to make utilities running on Unix.During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages.</p>

						<h2>There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.</li>
							<li>It must be robust and secure.</li>
							<li>It must be architecture-neutral and portable.</li>
							<li>It must execute with high performance.</li>
							<li>It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.</li>
